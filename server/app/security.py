"""HTTP hardening for the Jaga Padi backend: a conservative same-origin CORS policy,
security response headers, and an in-memory rate limiter guarding the expensive,
single-concurrency /api/chat and /api/parameter proxy endpoints.

The app runs as one uvicorn worker (single process, single event loop) served directly
over HTTPS with no reverse proxy in front, so plain in-memory rate-limit state is enough
(no Redis) and request.client.host is the real client IP (X-Forwarded-For would be
spoofable here, so it is deliberately ignored)."""
